An **SQL dump** is included for database setup, simplifying deployment and initialization.

## Key Features

- **Java Swing GUI**: Provides a user-friendly and interactive interface for handling order-related operations.
- **Layered Architecture**: Organized into distinct layers for presentation, business logic, and data access, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- **Reflection-Based Backend**: Uses Java reflection techniques to enable a flexible, dynamic backend.
- **PDF Invoice Generation**: Automatically generates a PDF invoice for each successfully processed order.
- **SQL Database Integration**: An SQL dump is included to facilitate easy database setup, with essential tables and sample data for testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Swing)**: For building the graphical user interface
- **Java Reflection API**: Adds flexibility to the backend
- **JDBC**: Manages database interactions
- **PDF Generation Libraries**: Used to create PDF invoices
